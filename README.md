A simple [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) project displaying a website in various responsive devices using an iframe. Available at [responsive.accudio.com](https://responsive.accudio.com). Limited by browser restrictions on framing, including restrictions on the X-Frame-Options header, and cannot display downgraded schemes (http -> https). If you know of a workaround for this or require a version hosted insecurely please get in touch.
